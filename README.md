# iSign - ASL Learning App

iSign is a machine learning ASL (American Sign Language) learning web application built with JavaScript, React.js, Tensorflow, and Firebase.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition:** Developed a custom ASL neural network from scratch to enable real-time hand gesture recognition and analysis.
- **TensorFlow Integration:** Integrated TensorFlow libraries for server-side model training, data preprocessing, and hand gesture recognition.
- **Node Server:** Built a Node server to host ASL machine learning models, enabling efficient real-time prediction and hand analysis.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- React.js
- TensorFlow
- Firebase
- Node.js
